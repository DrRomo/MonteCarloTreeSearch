# MonteCarloTreeSearch
My realization of Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm.

Explanation available in Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search).

This is just example, so don't be surprised by some shitty code and etc.

## Summary
My tic-tac-toe game uses bot based on MCTS. First of all, bot plays 10 games with another bot, not based on MCTS. Then MCTS-bot plays with player.
